Recommendation systems work as a counselor, behaving in such a way to guide
people in the discovery of products of interest.
There are various techniques and approaches in the literature 
that enable generating recommendations. This is interesting because 
it emphasizes the diversity of options; on the other hand, it can 
cause doubt to the system designer about which is the best technique to use. 
Each of these approaches has particularities and depends on the context to be 
applied. Thus, the decision to choose among techniques become complex 
to be done manually. This article proposes an evolutionary approach for 
combining results of recommendation techniques (Invenire) in order to automate 
the choice of techniques and get fewer errors in recommendations. 
To evaluate the proposal, experiments were performed with a dataset 
from MovieLens and some of Collaborative Filtering techniques. 
The results show that the combining methodology proposed in this 
paper performs better than any one of collaborative filtering 
technique separately in the context addressed. 
The improvement varies from $3,6\%$ to $118,99\%$ 
depending on the technique and the experiment executed.
